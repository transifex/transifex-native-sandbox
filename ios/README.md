This repository hosts two iOS sample apps written in Swift and Objective-C that make use
of the [Transifex iOS SDK](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-swift/).

## Usage

In order to run either the Swift or the Objective-C sample apps, you will need to rename
the `Secrets.xcconfig.sample` file found in each project to `Secrets.xcconfig` and 
change the value for the `TRANSIFEX_TOKEN` key to the value you have for your project.
